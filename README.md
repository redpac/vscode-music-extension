A simple vs code extension for those who enjoy listening to frutiger aero music during coding



## Installation

- Open your VS code and search for music-player and install it
- After installing it, open command pallate with `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd(⌘)+Shift+P` on MacOS
- Type in `Lofi Mix:Start lofi mix session` in the command pallate bar to see a music player at bottom left of your screen
- You can drag this section to the right side of your VS code for fixed viewing
- Initially the music player view is attached with the explorer side navbar of VS code so when a user switches side nav tabs, the music session stop
- To prevent this, drag this to the right side of VS code for a fixed and continous session
